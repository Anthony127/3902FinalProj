	Readability Cons:

		This class has a lot of calls to various sprites. I think the way the controllers are
		handled (adding them all to a list and updating from there) is probably
		how the sprites should be handled. It's a little hard to read through this class when
		all sprites are just kind of manually run down. I don't know if this would cause issues
		with interface implementation, but it might be worth looking into.


	Readability Pros:
		
		I think the way the factories are called and referenced to construct new items does a lot for readability. 
		It very quickly communicates where the sprites are created, and avoids showing the various constructors of
		the sprites. Localizing the sprites to specific factories seems like a win for readability as well.
