THE GOOD:

The overall quality of work this Sprint looks better in comparison to Sprint 4. This time around we made 
sure to include all the requirements we meet in some fashion, and that the code that executed them was of
good quality, trying to avoid quick fixes. Despite the time it took, removing the magic numbers has made it
easier to adjust and modify parameters used through classes to allow us to fix issues faster, in addition,
giving everything a name made it easier to track issues down when they occurred. Furthermore, the team dynamic
improved throughout this Sprint with our new teammate, enabling us to rely each other better to get our 
tasks done on time.

THE BAD:

While our time management issues from Sprint 4 did improve, it should be noted that they have not been 
fully fixed. During the initial implementation, our team failed to get all facets of the assignment 
ready to submit well before the 11:59 due time, causing us to rush to submit on time. Such things 
should be addressed and accounted for going into the last Sprint to reduce the stress applied to 
the team.
