THE GOOD:
The team's initial setup for project management for this sprint was very good. There 
were a reasonable amount of tasks which received additions and revisions throughout 
and everyone picked a section that they would focus on. The team's use of external 
tools such as making their on Discord server aided in communication throughout the sprint.

THE LESS-GOOD.
Talks about the Mario states throughout the sprint led to various considerations 
moving forward about the design of the game. Which is great. However, a number of 
ideas didn't become "more fully" fleshed out until the half-hour team session on 
the Wednesday that the sprint was due. Although it was good that we eventually 
got to that point, it would have been nice to be there a bit sooner. Other problems 
that the team ran into were issues related to Visual Studio and underestimating the 
time to completion for specific tasks.

THE SOLUTION:
In order to hopefully address and mitigate those items specified, our group hopes 
to have a weekly meeting call on Discord in order better plan out our sprints and 
address certain issues we've encountered as well as to dedicate more time to 
brainstorm and work out various aspects of the game's design.
