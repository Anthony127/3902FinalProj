Specific comments on code quality

	Coupling between this and the SuperPixelBrosGame is surprisingly loose, which is very well done. The constructor and 
	RegisterCommands methods could be easily combined into one. It seems somewhat unnecessary to break the command additions
	into a separate function, especially when the dictionary is created in the constructor. The splitting of the commandDictionary
	additions seems unnecessary. It could lower coupling to move all the commands for the game into this file, but that would
	make the file significantly longer.
