Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	Pros:
	Varible Names are readible and makes sense. 
	Method names tell exactly what each method is supposed to handle.
	Dictionaries now replace the old switch case logic, making the code more readible and managable.
	Common sense data driven dictionaries make reading what data is going where, and the actions occuring easy to identify.
	Handling code is short and concise.
	Cons:
	Dictionary code is extremely long, which breaks up the readibility of the file, which may be unavoidable, as this method is logically placed before the 
	dictionaries are used.
