It's not very clear what the difference between a song and a sound effect are, or when one would be used over the other. While the
content loading statements are easy to read and understand what they're doing, the LoadSongs and LoadSoundEffects methods seem very
long and intimidating, and it can be a bit confusing to parse out which effects and songs are getting added where. I'd recommend
bringing the load content statements and dictionary adding statements into one line for better cohesion. The titles of the songs and
sound effects are very good, but I can't seem to follow why some of the files were put in the Songs folder and some weren't.
