	The class is called PasswordUtility and as such it appears that the
	class actually only has one method, ParsePassword(). That, from my
	standpoint makes the class pretty clear in terms of deciphering what exactly 
	the class should and does do. I think that because the entire class 
	seems to only be doing one thing, and that is routing passwords, the class
	in general comes off pretty readable. It may make more sense for the 
	parsing method to be at the top of the file so it's easier to see, but
	all in all the functionality of the class seems very clear.

	On the other hand, I'm not sure if some of the dictionaries
	need to be separated. I'm curious if game changes and song
	changes really need to be separted. Both take an input string and
	both output a command object. It seems to me that the weird routing
	taking place where we search two command dictionaries in the 
	parsing function could be eliminated by simply combining these
	two dictionaries.

	Overall though, the class seems very readable and the intent of
	its functionality is overall clear.
