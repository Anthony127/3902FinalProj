Specific comments on code quality

Since the code references an abstract class, maintaing this code is really easy since we only change methods that pertain to the
function of the sprite. Everything else can be reused from a single base class, while we plug in changes like rowId or colId. 
Not much more can be said about his segement of code since they follow good coding guidlines.

Hypothetical Change:
Suppose we wish to add a swim animation for a water level. To accomplish this change, we first would make a new class for a swim 
animation similar to the walk animation or run animation for costumes. We then look up the indicies of the swim animation within the 
sprite sheet and make them colIds in the class. Then we go into the method, and overwrite the get source rectangle code to get the swim
rectangles of the spritesheet, and cycle through that animation for 30 frames. We would also update the hitbox to match them from 
the matrix frames.
