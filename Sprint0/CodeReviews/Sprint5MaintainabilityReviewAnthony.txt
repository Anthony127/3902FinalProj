Specific comments on code quality

The HUD class was designed to purely observe the score fields within a given scorekeeper class. It does not need to know what 
the scorekeeper does to keep the score, only how to ask the scorekeeper for how many coins Mario has for example. 
This leads to a low coupling of the two classes, as they only share information, and do not need to know how each 
other works. We have high extensibility since to extend the functionality of the class we just add more print 
statements, and format them to the screen.

Hypothetical Changes

For example let’s suppose we want to keep track of how many enemies Mario has stomped on screen. This is an easy 
addition for the HUD. Let’s say that somehow the scorekeeper has and maintains a StompCount field that increments 
every time an enemy gets stomped. To add this counter to the screen through the HUD class, we only need to add a
print statement to the Draw Method that says “Stomp Count = Scorekeeper.Instance.StompCount.ToString” and format 
it’s location on screen.
