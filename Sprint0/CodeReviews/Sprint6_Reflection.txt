THE GOOD:
The team's initial setup for project management for this sprint was very good. Everyone participated in this sprint
and helped contribute on parts of the project that needed more work where needed. Team synergy was at an all time high since
we were collaborating on a brand new idea for a sprint instead of brainstorming on given ideas.

THE LESS-GOOD.
Communication from when the sprint was assigned to a few days before the due date was not great due to holidays, and other classes
hindered our time and time management. Feature were not completely decided on until the day before the sprint was due, and while they were
all completed, the time constraint did not help in making sure these were 100% error free.

THE SOLUTION:
Since the class is drawing to a close, one thing that we can take with us is to communicate better as a team in future groups
so that even if the project is not being activly developed by everyone on the team, there is still a strong plan forward that 
anyone can pickup and start working on. Another possible solution is to set aside a stricter meeting date that everyone can attend 
unless exams or dire family related events dictate otherwise.
