Specific comments on code quality

	There's a fair amount of duplicated code in the LevelDraw function when iterating through the arrays of 
	enemies, blocks, and items. This could be lessened by having a list of lists that we can iterate through
	in a nested foreach. Mario could also be in this list of lists to remove the additional call to draw him
	as well. The same issue is in the LevelUpdate function and could be resolved in the same way. These could
	both use the same list of lists, as well. There is a lot of duplicated, long method calls when processing
	the collisions. This could be solved with, again, a list of lists. Also, each of these methods takes the
	same CollisionHandler. It's possible it would be better to make the CollisionIterator Singleton and to
	have the CollitionHandler as a field.
