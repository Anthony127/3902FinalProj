PlayerLevel.cs by Jacob Starett
Time taken: 20 minutes

All of the specifying elements of the player level have setters at the end of the file, separated from the getters, which
makes it initially unclear that these are settable fields. I recommend moving them up by the getters. It seems unnecessarily
complicated to have everything separated into IEnemy, IBlock, and IItem, also creating many foreach loops that are pretty hard
to follow. I recommend making some sort of GameObject interface to encapsulate all of these items so everything can be drawn
and updated in a more concise, easy-to-follow loop.

There are many calls to the collisionIterator to process different types of collisions, which is quite bulky. I recommend a
mediator method that can take in all the needed arrays and make these calls in a more sequestered location. There are three
calls to collisionDetector and corresponding if loops that have been commented out. If these aren't being used, they should be
removed.
