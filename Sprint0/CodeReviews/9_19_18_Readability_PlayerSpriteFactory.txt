	Readability Cons:

		Now that we've changed Mario into a state-based object, it's probably not necessary to include so many 
		different sprite creation functions. It kind of clogs the readability of the class as we really only
		need to have a few methods in here to return, maybe, small, big, fire, and dead Mario.


	Readability Pros:
		
		The factory class really cleans up the SuperPixelBrosGame.cs main file, so we don't have to see any object constructors.
		Furthermore, the factories only require one passing of the spritesheet so we don't have to continously keep
		track of a texture any time we'd like to spawn a new sprite. This really assists readability in places (like
		SuperPixelBrosGame.cs) where we spawn multiple sprites.
