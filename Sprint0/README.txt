Notes:


 - > Any Code in the folder OLD is outside of the project and not intended to be compiled

 - > According to our research, small mario grabbing a fire flower produces large mario, not fire mario

 - > Two warnings are currently being surpressed, one in the Level loader for cyclomatic complexity (file not graded)
	 and one in the main game file for "graphics" not being used (used by MonoGame, if we take this out, fails to boot)
