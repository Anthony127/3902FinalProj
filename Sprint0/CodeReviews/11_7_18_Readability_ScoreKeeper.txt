	Notes on Readability:

	The file seems to be at first glance very long and sometimes hard to navigate. For example, the various getter and setter methods present here
	make it difficult to determine what exactly the file is doing. Without an interface this does make it a bit harder as well. Many methods have
	unclear functions as well. Increment coins obviously increments coins, but does it need that many lines to wrap its count? Wouldn't a % operator
	make things a bit more clear and easy on the eyes here?

	On the other hand, the various methods for the most part appear to be very readable viewed in a vacuum. If we ignore how many methods are here,
	each individual method generally only has one or two lines making it very easy to determine what exactly each method does.

	To conclude, I'd recommend reducing the amount of methods here into properties
