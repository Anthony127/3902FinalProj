SoundFactory.cs by Alexander Yehsakul

All of the songs are being loaded in the LoadSongs method, even though most of them are not being used ceating a [long method]
and creating a significant number of unnecessary Song objects.

The LoadSongs and LoadSoundEffects methods both add sound by creating a Song or SoundEffect object, then, in a separate call, adding
the new object to the proper library. This could be accomplished in a single line, thus cutting down on the [long method].

In the PlaySong method, there's no check to make sure song isn't null before calling MediaPlayer.Play, leaving a risk for
a NullPointerException.

Recommendation: The LoadSongs and LoadSoundEffects methods could be combined into the LoadContent method, and the calls to add the sounds
into the dictionaries could all be one line instead of a creation line and an addition line, thus clearing up both memory and vastly
reducing the size of the class. This would be a relatively simple, yet time-consuming change. Lots of code would need to be moved, but
nothing really new would need to be written.
