Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	Pros:
	Varible Names are readible and makes sense. 
	Method names tell exactly what each method is supposed to handle
	Overall lenght of the code is small which make the file easier to read.
	No global varible, mean that every varible is handled in it's own method, no need to worry about losing the meaning of a varible 
	while reading this file.
	Cons:
	Individual method length in the Handle Collision is quite long, due to the multitude of switch cases in the method, I would recommend trying to remove 
	these cases if possible to increase readibility
