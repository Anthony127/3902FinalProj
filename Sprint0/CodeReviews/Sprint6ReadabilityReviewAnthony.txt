Specific comments on code quality

	Since the code has been absstracted from the sprite base class, the overall length of this file is short. We only overwrite 
	the methods that need to be changed for the costume sprites. Method names are logical, and varible names follow in form as 
	the matrix row column form of the sprite sheet. Due to the short nature of these classes, they are extremely easy to read and
	understand since the only overriden methods corrsepond to the function of the method. Like replacing source rectangles for a walking
	animation for a sprite depending on the rowId.
