THE GOOD:

The overall product delivered over this sprint, I personally feel has been pretty good. Although we did not manage to
include every single thing required this sprint, the ones we do have seem to work well. Furthermore, the team became
significantly more familiar with several design patterns (decorator for popped enemies for instance) and various other 
nuances of C# (like interface properties). Furthermore, the team also instroduced a new team member to the group this
sprint and that seems to have gone fairly well and relatively smoothly.

THE BAD:

The team's time management fell by the wayside this sprint. With integrating a new team member, fall break, and several
more ethereal concepts this sprint, the team ran a bit short on time this sprint. In the future, I think we'll need
to continue to remain vigilant in our management, despite most of the team getting a little tired of programming
and managing the project. We hope next sprint, we'll learn to plan our research time a bit more effectively and
thus make Sprint 5 an even better showing of our capabilities as a team.
