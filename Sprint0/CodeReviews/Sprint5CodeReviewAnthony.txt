Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	Pros:
		By making the level conform to the state pattern and an abstract class, this file is easier to read since the methods contained in these files are ones that are 
		changed from the standard implementation.
		Methods are naturally short, and extremely to the point if the do not implement the standard from AbstractGameState.
		Method name conform to a standard for all game state classes, so it is easy to find and compare differences to different game states.
		Overall File length is very short.

	Cons:
		By using an abstract class, to reference difference between implementing classes and the abstract class we need to look at two different files.
