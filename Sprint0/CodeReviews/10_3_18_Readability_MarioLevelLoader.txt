	So this class seems to have several strings it's managing to begin with. It uses a switch case to select which parameter it is reading in,
	and then once all three parameters are returned, it goes through another switch statement to select what item it's going build into the level.
	I don't really think the booleans are necessary here--they seem to only decrease readability when we could just check the strings to see if they
	obtained values. Also on that note, when we're checking for parameters, I think the initial switch statement is just begging for its own method.
	We could probably just put those parameters in their own sub-loop in their own method that returns each. Or, we could even have three separate
	methods that obtain a different parameter. I think this drastically increases readability by moving one part of the "reading" of the level outside
	of the mega while(reader.Read()) loop.

	Also, in reference to the larger multi level switch statement, as all the code is primarily doing similar things, I think this section would fit 
	nicely into a dictionary structure. For example, we could learn the type of each object (key) and then call its constructor through reflection based
	on what the dictionary returns. The rest of the code in each case would operate the same.
