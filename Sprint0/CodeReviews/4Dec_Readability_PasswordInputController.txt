	Notes on Readability:

	The variable names are pretty unclear, with a StringBuilder simply called "stringbuilder" and a TextInfo simply called "ti"
	These should be replaced with more clear names, indicating what they're actually used for. There's a large foreach iterating
	over all of the pressed keys, but the logic is difficult to follow. Comments would be helpful.

	Overall, the logic of the controller is somewhat difficult and by its nature will be difficult to read, but this is well done
	given the circumstances.
